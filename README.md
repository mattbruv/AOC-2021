# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

Most solutions are in Python because it is the language that I can most
easily express my thoughts in.
It is a delightful language to use for these puzzles.

Some problems I solved in my own custom Lisp language,
[mplisp](https://github.com/mattbruv/mplisp):
